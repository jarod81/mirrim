Mirrim allows you to use your RFID reader Mir:ror from Violet on your linux distribution without using the Violet website.

Follow the installation notice and launch scripts by just moving on or out any zstamps or little rabbit.

Mirrim is based on the work done on erawrim. But in order to have simpler installation, all the functionnalities are embedded in only one pure C software.

Mirrim is still in alpha and was only tested on Debian Lenny.

Comments and bug reports are welcomed.

Source code will be available soon.
